## Monitoring Hub

The [Monitoring hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/monitoring-hub) includes various Microsoft Fabric activities, such as Semantic Model refreshes and Spark Notebook runs. It's available for workloads from Power BI, Data Factory, Data Engineering and Data Science.


## Capacity monitoring

Use the [Capacity Metrics App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) and get:

 - Tenant wide visibility into capacity usage for all Fabric workloads in one place
 - Identify resource usage trends across artifacts and operations 
 - Monitor the impact of throttling to user experience to make scale-up decisions
 - View preview usage in parallel with production workloads to make data-driven capacity sizing decisions
 - Zoom in to analyze workload operations and artifacts with full fidelity down to 30 second granularity
 - View the impact of long-running jobs against capacity limits with smoothing applied
 - Realtime visibility of in progress operations
 - Analyze user experience to efficiently scale and optimize
